<p>I have run a campaign that is honest and
above-board, positive, filled with real content, and gentlemanly toward
my opponents.  I have been unfairly attacked in mailers funded by an
out-of-town political activist group and an in-town mom who has
apparently swallowed the blogged-about misinformation.  <strong>Longmont deserves better than this</strong>.</p>
<p>On Saturday January 19th there arrived in Longmont mailboxes an
attack piece containing partial information, effective misquotations by
selecting material out of context, and the like.  It is paid for by
Colorado League of Taxpayers.  Midweek before the election, an
eight-page letter sent to many houses in Longmont repeats much of this
misinformation. I suppose I am flattered that my campaign raises such
attention, but I would have preferred to have a conversation about the
major content of my platform rather than deal with inaccuracies,
out-of-context quotations, and mis-formed statements.  My campaign for
Council has plenty of positive material to work with that is
unchallenged, and my campaign has been positive and above-board and
shall remain that way.  Nevertheless I am impelled to respond to errors,
 purposeful misinterpretations, and shortcomings in the attack piece.
Kerry failed to respond to inaccurate attack ads and it cost him, so
I’ll take a lesson there.</p>
<p>A few elements of the attack piece are worth responding to.  My
choosing certain ones should in no way be regarded as an admission that
others are accurate, of course.  I simply have some other things to
spend my time on right now.</p>
<p>Let me count some ways…</p>
<p>1.  “Being more like Boulder sure sounds good to me!” — a Juday supporter.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the context for that quotation.  In the letter of
support from Craig Smith, the entirety of which you can find on this
website, we find (<strong>emphasis added</strong> and quotation in <strong><font color="#ff0000">red</font></strong>):</p>
<p style="background-color: #00ffff">“While exactly duplicating another
city isn’t possible or even desirable, what would it actually mean to
Longmont residents if we were more like Boulder?</p>
<p style="background-color: #00ffff">“It would mean that there might be a <strong>pedestrian-friendly downtown area</strong> that actually attracted <strong>high-quality restaurants, bars and upscale shops rather than pawn shops</strong>. We might be able to sit at an outdoor table and enjoy a <strong>quiet meal without listening to semi-trailer trucks and mufflerless motorcycles</strong> roaring by 30 feet away on U.S. Highway 287. There might be <strong>more walking and bicycling trails</strong> and other opportunities for outdoor recreation.</p>
<p style="background-color: #00ffff">“Most importantly, <strong>our property values would be significantly higher and less affected by market downturns </strong>such
 as the presently bursting housing bubble. The past city councils have
lead Longmont down the path of unlimited housing with sprawl in every
direction. A more limited housing supply is actually beneficial for our
residents. <strong>Boulder, with its limited growth policies, actually
cares more about the long-term welfare of its current citizens than
about the short-term infusion of fees from outside real estate
developers</strong>. What a concept.</p>
<p style="background-color: #00ffff"><strong><font color="#ff6600">“Being more like Boulder sure sounds good to me! </font></strong>Vote for Richard Juday . He has the vision and commitment to make Longmont a much more livable community.”</p>
<p> I can certainly live with the vision of Boulder-like aspects that Smith describes.  Couldn’t you?</p>
<p>2.  The flier states — <u><em>knowingly incorrectly </em></u>– that I
 advocate tracing customers to their residence by writing down license
numbers.  Here’s the context that this misinformation is drawn from:</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00ffff">I would have an IGA in place
before BBS, Inc., ever even thought of building in City A. Under the IGA
 plan, City A would recover its infrastructure and administrative costs
from the sales tax heap, and the balance would be distributed according
to the proportion of income its citizens provide to BBS, Inc. <font color="#ff0000"><strong>There
 are two ways to do the accounting; one would be to have a customer
designate the City to which the sales tax revenue goes, and the other is
 to do occasional studies of customer populations (write down license
numbers and trace them to residence; in-store surveys, etc.). </strong><strong>I
 prefer having the customer report his city. The actual price of the
goods is fairly represented, there is no invasion of privacy, the
register burden is low (I already have to enter my Zip Code when using
my American Express card at numerous gasoline stations).</strong> </font>The
 reportage should be accurate in that a customer is motivated to have
his tax dollar go to his own city. In my example, City A might take 10%
off the top for administrative costs, and of the 90% remaining, half
would go to City A, a quarter to City B, etc. </span></p>
<p>Notice that having offered other methods of tracking the city from which a sale originates, I am explicit that the <u><em>customer-reported method </em></u>is
 the one to use.  That redounds to the benefit of the customer’s own
city’s tax revenue.  I’d go beyond that to say that a customer could
certainly decline to provide such information, though that would be to
the detriment of his city.</p>
<p>3.  Something of a deal is made in the websites cited in the attack
piece about out-of-state donors to my campaign, as though there were
something malfeasant about friends or family making a campaign
contribution.  Longmont election rules explicitly permit such
contributions, of course.  If you are interested, I’ll be glad to tell
you more about my hiking buddies, anthropology prof and woodworking pal,
 former girlfriend, patent attorney who worked for me as an
undergraduate student twenty years ago, several-times-flown astronaut,
etc.  Not a politico in the bunch.  Just long-time personal friends who
know me well enough to support me in my campaign.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The writer of the eight-page letter has recovered a page
from my campaign of two years ago, in which I pledged to raise no funds
for my campaign in that 2005 election.&nbsp; Indeed I accepted no
contributions to that election, as may be verified with the City
Clerk.&nbsp; She mistakenly thinks I had established that policy for the
 2008 special election, but made no attempt to verify that with me. I’d
have clarified that situation for her even as I clarify it for the
reader here.</p>
<p>– Richard Juday</p>
