<p>I think that voters in Longmont elections should be able to see all contributions made to every candidate <em>before</em>
 casting their votes.   Under the Election Code, it is permissible to
accept donations even after the election, with a final accounting due
only 30 days <em>after</em> the election.  As I announced to local news
media at the beginning of the election season that concludes on 29th
January, I am accepting no more donations after the report required to
be filed with the City Clerk by noon on 23rd January.  I removed the
“donate” PayPal button from the website before that filing, for example,
 and checks arriving in the mail are being returned (with thanks).</p>
<p>I think it would be nice were the other candidates to do likewise.</p>
Campaign finance reports can be viewed at the [City Clerk’s website](http://www.ci.longmont.co.us/city_clerk/election/candidates/index.htm).
