Council should create an <em>ad hoc</em>  advisory committee of volunteer technical experts who live and work in
Longmont, to advise on issues beyond the expertise of city staff or
council. Members would be tasked to provide recommendations that don’t
rise to the level of requiring outside consultants.</li>
<li> Longmont should enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement with its
 surrounding neighbors to prevent “big box” chains from pitting one city
 against the other for special consideration in locating within
communities. Revenue sharing of sales taxes would be based upon costs to
 the hosting community and by recorded zip codes of shoppers.</li>
<li> Longmont should investigate tax abatement strategies for local
small businesses that provide living wages and benefits, so that a more
level playing field is established with price-competitive large chains.</li>
