<div class="post"><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt">In November the voters approved a lodging tax intended to support and develop tourism for Longmont, and there has arisen a controversy about the exact manner in which it is to be spent.<span>  </span>There
 have been some speculations about exact items on which the funds might
be spent, and there is an anxiety on the part of LAVA that their
research and their work to inform the voters might have a benefit
directed elsewhere.<span>  </span></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt">I
 think all would agree that the “pillow tax” money, like any other tax
funds, must be expended in a wholly responsible manner, and ultimately
directed by elected officials. <span> </span>The federal acquisition regulations (FAR) lay out some procurement procedures that we can adapt here.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Procurements of different sizes logically operate under different rules – snowplows are harder to buy than staples.<span>  </span>In
 this instance there is the added consideration of a raised public
sensitivity to where the funds go, how they get there, and what the
accountability is. <span> </span>A general principle is, in my opinion, that <em><em><font face="Times New Roman">no private organization has an inherent and absolute right to tax funds</font></em></em>. <span> </span>That
 said, I would expect LAVA to propose for a contract to do the work, and
 the association might indeed come to benefit from their civic-oriented
efforts. <span> </span>One might even guess that LAVA will turn in a
very sound proposal, but if other organizations submit competent
proposals, all proposals are to be evaluated on an equal basis.<span>  </span></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Here’s
 the process I suggest, based on the size of the funds, the contention
the situation has raised, and the benefit the public expects from the
tax. <span> </span>First the City issues a Request for Information, in
which the task is described in general terms with the opportunity for
interested organizations to influence the detailed form and content of
the subsequent request for proposals (RFP). <span> </span>Then the RFP
is distributed, including stated performance goals and a schedule for
attaining them, demonstrated competence of the organization to carry
them out, and other relevant items. <span> </span>Included in the RFP are the criteria against which the proposals will be quantitatively compared and given a grade. <span> </span>Negotiations
 are conducted with responders who supply proposals that meet the basic
criteria, and the contract is made with the organization whose proposal
comes out best for the citizens. That’s simple enough, right? In federal
 practice it’s often lengthier than an eager technologist just wanting
to get the job done is happy with, but in the end it’s fair, it’s
visible, and it works to the advantage of the taxpayer.<span>  </span></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt">There
 has been a commotion about exactly what activities the tax may be used
to support. Whatever the details of the result end up being, they are
governed by the wording the voters approved, since this is clearly not a
 General Fund kind of tax. The City Attorney has the responsibility to
lay out the range of possible performance items that can be included in a
 contract to use these funds, and to assure that the RFI, RFP, and
contract language conforms. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Because
 of the sensitivity the public has shown to this matter, I would want a
“Sunshine” provision to the contract. That is, the contractor would be
required to conduct its business in a public manner. <span> </span>Meetings, discussions, decisions would be done only with prior announcement and with full access to the public. <span> </span>That’s how Council operates, it’s how the Boulder County tax-spending committee I sit on operates, and it’s how the public has
come to expect its public organizations to operate in general. <span> </span>I
 don’t know that City contracts ordinarily have such a stipulation, but
this is a controversial situation that can only benefit from this
openness.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Certainly
 LAVA worked very hard (and long!) to research the best way to use the
lodging tax and subsequently to persuade the voters that this is a
worthy venture. <span> </span>I anticipate that LAVA would respond to an RFI so that an RFP and contract that are to the citizens’ benefit can be written.<span>  </span>With LAVA’s detailed knowledge of the Longmont situation I would expect them to turn in a good proposal, and I would not be surprised were it to be the successful proposal. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt">But I do not think that LAVA “owns” the tax money. Only the taxpaying public can make that claim of ownership.<span>  </span>The voters decided to impose the tax, and Council’s responsibility is to spend it well.<span>  </span></span></font></p>
