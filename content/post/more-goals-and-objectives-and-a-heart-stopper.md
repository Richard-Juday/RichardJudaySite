Richard Juday believes that…
<ul>
<li> Council should manage the City’s budget so that income from growth
is devoted solely to new infrastructure. Operational expenses should be
funded only from stable, consistent income sources.</li>
<li> Council should exercise greater oversight of City staff and seek a wider range of opinions, analyses and recommendations.</li>
<li> Council should reach out to all ethnic and social groups. Council
should continue to support El Comité in its efforts to mainstream recent
 legal arrivals through English as a Second Language (ESL) and other
programs.</li>
<li> Council should re-establish and enforce school benchmarks. Building
 permits should not be issued if they will result in school
overpopulation and unfunded facilities.</li>
<li> Council should cooperate in revitalizing education, support public
school financing and assist Front Range Community College in locating
permanent accommodations.</li>
<li> Council should devote greater attention to the redevelopment of the City’s downtown and central neighborhoods.</li>
<li> Council should re-examine its plans for water storage, Union
Reservoir, open space acquisition and wildlife habitat preservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now for the heart-stopper.  This is a recipe I remember from my childhood, my mother’s <strong>Black Bottom Pie</strong>.  She’s a resident on the Alzheimer’s ward in a nursing home here in Longmont.</p>
<p>Most of my favorite recipes include the phrase, “Melt a stick of butter…”</p>

> ### Black Bottom Pie
>
> Start with a large collection of pots and pans, ‘cause this one uses a lot of ‘em!
>
> Soak 3 envelopes of gelatin in ¾ cup milk.  Scald 4½ cups milk over low heat.  Make a doubled graham cracker crust from 2 packages of crackers, 1 stick of melted butter, ½ cup confectioner’s sugar; press it into the bottom of a 9´13 inch cake pan.  Shave or chop 4½ oz baking chocolate.  Separate 12 eggs.  To the yolks, add ½ Tbsp salt, 4 Tbsp cornstarch; mix, then add 1½ cup sugar.  Slowly add the scalded milk.  Stir constantly (a whisk is a good thing to use here) in a double boiler.  When thick, remove 1½ cups of the custard and melt the chocolate into it along with 1 Tbsp vanilla.  Add gelatin to custard.  Beat the egg whites stiff; add 1½ cups sugar.  To custard add ¾ cup rum, then the egg whites.  Pour over the graham cracker crust.  Whip a pint of cream, add 2 Tbsp confectioner’s sugar.  Top the pie with the whipped cream.  Shave chocolate over the whipped cream for decoration.  Refrigerate.
