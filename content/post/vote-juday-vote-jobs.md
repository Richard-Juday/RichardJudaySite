<li>Is Qualified</li>

<li>Is Prepared to Serve</li>
</ul>
<p>Longmont is increasingly dependent upon the contributions of science and technology to meet its economic and quality of life needs.  Longmont has a solid foundation of high technology businesses, but we need to do more.  We should aggressively seek emerging technology from within the university and government research institutions in our vicinity.</p>
<p>Businesses recruited to Longmont will not only bring permanent, high-paying jobs, but will also bring qualified workers and homebuyers to Longmont, alleviating its depressed housing market and raising the value of existing homes.</p>
<p>I am an engineer, retired from NASA.  As such, I bring a perspective that will complement the talents and capabilities of the current City Council.  As a respected and accomplished scientist, I understand the needs of high technology industry and the judgment to find what fits Longmont. As a laboratory manager, I can communicate with business in its environment and in its language. As a retiree, I have the time to commit.  As an active and productive volunteer in and around Longmont for several years, I have shown that I have the ability and staying power to contribute.</p>
<p>I can serve Longmont well and I am committed to preserving it as a wonderful place to live.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your vote</strong> and for joining me for a better, brighter Longmont.</p>
