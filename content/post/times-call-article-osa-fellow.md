Richard Juday has been awake since 2 a.m. preparing a packet  about his life. At 8 a.m., he slaps it in front of me - a thick, stapled stack  of papers and a digital version on CD - grabs a cup of coffee and waits for me  to begin. At that moment, I am certain about one thing: Juday, a “retired” NASA scientist, is thorough, organized and very smart.He  anticipated my questions; included 11 pages of his patents and titles of his  published scientific works; added other fun, quirky bits about himself (he once  worked night shift in a pickle factory); and tried to explain his complicated  research, which led to his most recent honor.Just before the new year,  Juday, 65, was elevated to the rank of “fellow” of the Optical Society of  America for his accomplishments in optical science. He’s one of 58 scientists - out of 15,000 OSA members worldwide - who will be recognized by the association  this year.</p>
<p>“It’s a recognition of achievement by my peers, and that’s a  nice thing,” Juday said.</p>
<p>His award was for “technical  contributions in optical correlation pattern recognition.”</p>
<p>To explain,  Juday begins drawing a cartoon of his spatial light modulator and its use  in optical correlators. In simple terms, modulators write a digital image onto a  laser beam; optical correlators extract information from an image.</p>
<p>In one  application of his research, Juday developed a method for missiles to  recognize an enemy tank and hit it (and not hit one of our own). The pattern  recognition happens at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Juday has other patents  that use similar types of technology. One allows ophthalmologists to safely seal  bleeding blood vessels in the retina. The technology uses an optical correlator  to follow the twitches of a patient’s eyeball so the surgeon can hit the  targeted vessel and avoid damaging other parts of the eye.</p>
<p>OSA executive  director Elizabeth Rogan said scientists who not only successfully complete  research but also figure out how to apply it are “stellar.”</p>
<p>“This is a  huge recognition by people who also are highly esteemed in the field,” Rogan  said. “The judges are at the top of their peer class. (The award) really  recognizes they’re an exceptional member in the field.”</p>
<p>Juday  retired and moved to Longmont in September 2001 with his wife, Darcy Temple,  after working for NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston for 35  years.</p>
<p>Juday’s work there included using remote sensing  information for crop-production forecasts, research involving radiation hazards  for manned space flight, and research that provided vision for NASA’s robotic  applications, such as spacecraft docking or having a robotic assistant find a  wrench in space. He also championed several optical research development  projects in Boulder and Longmont and, under NASA’s Small Business Innovative  Research program, directed several million dollars to local  businesses.</p>
<p>“I was able to retire in a place where I had influenced  technical activity,” he said.</p>
<p>Juday’s list of extracurricular  activities is almost as extensive as his professional bio. He’s president of his  homeowners association and has participated in several city of Longmont boards.  He enjoys woodworking, snowshoeing and traveling, and he plans to return to  beekeeping this spring. He competes at a national level in badminton in the  Senior Olympics.</p>
<p>In 2005, Juday ran for Longmont City Council. He  participates in the city of Longmont’s Economic Vitality Task Force and sits on  a committee that advises Boulder County commissioners on the expenditure of  Scientific and Cultural Facilities District sales tax revenue. He also teaches  optics to local middle school students.</p>
<p>He’s still active with the OSA  and is a member of the Boulder chapter. He also co-wrote “Correlation Pattern  Recognition” (Cambridge University Press; 2005), which is used as a textbook for  graduate electrical engineering students.</p>
<p>“My wife would tell you I am  really not quite retired,” Juday said. “I have no intention of slowing down.”</p>
