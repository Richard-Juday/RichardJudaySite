<p>It is one thing to name lofty visions and desirable goals.  It is quite another thing to be able to attain them.</p>
<p>My background and accomplishments demonstrate that I set reasonable
goals and then act, not just dream and talk.  High-minded principles and
 windy statements by aspiring politicians are one thing.  But ability is
 another.  In choosing whom to vote for, compare the abilities and the
demonstrated performance of the candidates.</p>
<p><font color="#ff6600"><strong>I ACT</strong></font> for<u> jobs and business</u>,
 the lifeblood of family and community.  I am working to create, and
have in fact created, jobs in this area.  I am a technical reviewer for
the metro-Denver WIRED, a federally funded initiative to develop jobs
and placements.  I spent NASA money in championing the transfer of a new
 technology from lab bench at CU into what is now CDM Optics, a healthy
company employing over 50.  I similarly directed almost a million
dollars to Longmont’s DisplayTech, and the technology there now supports
 another Longmont company, InPhase, in its world-class holographic data
storage.  I am an advisor in optics to CTEK and a member of Magellan
Research Center, both in Longmont.  I sit on the Economic Vitality Task
Force and wrote Appendix A that deals with growth within our limits.  I
am a respected technologist (Fellow of international optics
organizations; multiple patents; book; etc.) and as such I speak the
lingo and have early access to emerging technology.  On Council I’ll be
in a position to court promising businesses to locate here.  New high
tech businesses will also add many more jobs in other areas such as
restaurants, retail stores, city work, etc.</p>
<p><font color="#ff6600"><strong>I ACT</strong></font> for <u>community</u>.
  From serving on my HOA board (in third term as president) I understand
 and foster community within neighborhoods.  I liked getting an
unsolicited note saying “Hi, Richard, Thanks for your hard work on our
behalf for the HOA.  You keep us thinking about the community and up to
date on its events.  For awhile I had forgotten we had an HOA but not
anymore.”  Reading that made my day.  Helping distribute federal funds
for community development within the historic east side gave me a lot of
 insight into Longmont’s problems.</p>
<p><font color="#ff6600"><strong>I ACT </strong></font>for <u>science and the arts</u> in Longmont.  I’m in my second year representing Longmont on the Boulder County committee that distributes SCFD tax money.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#ff6600">I ACT</font></strong> for <u>education</u>.
  For years I have taught optics to middle schoolers and judged at the
State science fair.  I mentored dozens of students working in my NASA
lab and renting rooms in my house.  A perennial complaint from my
neighbors is school overcrowding.  On Council I will work to
re-establish building benchmarks, preventing over-construction of new
residential areas that would overcrowd schoolrooms.  This requires
coordination among City, school district, and developers.  It requires
firm resolution on the part of Council, and I have that.  Developers
adapt to clear direction from the City, and it’s in the best interest of
 the community.</p>
<p><font color="#ff6600"><strong>I ACT</strong></font> for the <u>citizens at large</u>.
  I reject support by PACs or cabals of financially self-interested
individuals who would hope to steer decisions of “their” candidate on
council.  I am retired and I have no personal financial axe to grind in
this election.  Of course business interests will be respected, too,
especially as they advance the community - that is, the entire
citizenry.  I would think the owners of vacant houses, business parks,
and warehouses should support me for my activism in bringing jobs to
Longmont.  I’ll work for jobs to fill foreclosed houses and empty
offices, and to hold up the value of all our homes.</p>
<p>I respectfully request your vote.</p>
